# The Project Portfolio
This is the new Project Portfolio containing all of the projects I do in order to teach myself to code. Tutorial Purgatory is real and I intend to escape it by just plain doing stuff! Below, I intend to put information that I find. Things that are interesting, clever, efficient, or just cool. 
## Python
## HTML
## CSS
## JavaScript
## SQL
