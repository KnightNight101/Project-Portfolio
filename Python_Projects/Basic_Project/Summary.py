# So in order to keep the techniques learned fresh, I think that it's best to create a seperate project that has all of them in it
# This will NOT have copied code, but will have the topics and commands learned in it

# A place to import things
import sys
# Going to start with the version of python 
print("Hello, welcome to the Learning Summary Project! \nWe're currently Running on version: "+str(sys.version))
# String Manipulation
FullName = input("Please enter your first and last name: ")
FirstName, LastName = FullName.split()
print("Ah, " + str(LastName)+ " , first name " + str(FirstName) " !\n")
Mood = input("How are you doing today?: ")
print("Hmmm.... \n")
# Pick Object from list
